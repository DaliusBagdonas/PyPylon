Version 1.0.7
    - Date 2016-08-22
    - Use Pylon version 5.0.5.
    - Let development builds have a valid version number.
    - Drop the distribution of the deprecated modules 'pylon' and 'genicam' (
      see notes for 1.0.0). Without them import statements have to be in the
      form of 'import pypylon.pylon'. Those who still want to use these legacy
      modules have to use the ones from the last release.
    - Thanks to an improvement in the way Pylon for windows loads its libraries
      the workaround in the pypylon.pylon module for loading the transport
      layer DLLs is no longer necessary and was removed.
    - Add support for BCON TL in Linux builds as well (up to now it was only
      included in Windows builds).

Version 1.0.6
    - Date 2016-06-07
    - Improve error message for accessing an invalid GrabResult attribute.
    - In order to adapt to changes in the BCON transport layer, use Pylon
      5.0.2.8501 for creating the windows builds.

Version 1.0.5
    - Date 2016-05-17
    - On Windows pypylon for python 3.5 did not distribute the library
      'msvcp140.dll' although it depends on it. Now that file is distributed
      as well.
    - Add support for BCON TL

Version 1.0.4
    - Date 2016-04-25
    - Fixed two minor memory leaks
    - Module genicam: Fixed all methods that use a feature_list_t to
      return properly casted types.
    - On windows the pylon camera link files are now distributed.
    - Change the way the DLL seach path is handled for windows. The previous
      way of that handling was easily disturbed by importing other modules.

Version 1.0.3
    - Date 2016-01-14
    - Fixed a multi-threading issue in the genicam callback mechamism.
    - Reworked build scripts for Linux.

Version 1.0.2
    - Date 2016-01-12
    - Make pypylon requirement of legacy modules less restrictive. Instead of
      being tied to a certain version of pypylon, the legacy modules now simply
      depend on 'pypylon'.
    - Version 1.0.0 tried to fix a build warning. That change unintentionally
      corrupted the support for the genicam callback mechamism. Now the callback
      support is operational again.

Version 1.0.1
    - Date 2015-12-09
    - Fix arm build

Version 1.0.0
    - Date 2015-12-09
    - Use pylon5 copy deloyment feature in order to deliver a more self
      contained pypylon. Now the only thing that needs to be present aside
      from python and pypylon are the pylon drivers - no more need for a
      complete pylon installation.
    - Using the copy deployment feature leads to an INCOMPATIBLE change in
      module/package layout. Up to this point 'pylon' and 'genicam' have been
      simple modules that could be imported directly - e.g. 'import pylon'.
      Now there is the package 'pypylon' that consists of the modules 'pylon'
      and 'genicam'. So the import has to look like this 'import pypylon.pylon'.
    - In order to ease the transition to the new layout, the 'legacy' packages
      'pylon' and 'genicam' are provided. When those are installed in addition
      to 'pypylon' client code can still use the import 'import pylon' or
      'import genicam'. These new 'legacy' packages are marked as 'deprecated'
      and will be dropped at some point in the future.
    - pypylon.pylon and pypylon.genicam now have an attribute named
      '__version__' that contains the version string.

Version 0.9.0 and 0.9.1
    - Date 2015-11-06
    - First steps towards using pylon5's copy deployment feature.

Version 0.3.0
    - Date 2015-11-04
    - Build on pylon5 and genicam 3

Version 0.2.0
    - Date 2015-09-07
    - Lots of stuff happend before this release - have to look at git history.
    - Probably the last version that builds on pylon4. If there will be a need
      for further pylon4 builds, these will stick to version 0.2.xx.
